## Planning 

This project is solo.  Below is my plan for each week as it works with my schedule.  Wednesday I do not work and the weekend will be the most time I am able to commit to the projects.

## Risks
Scope - This is a large project with only one person working to complete everything within the 8 week timeframe.  

Goals - I have big goals and would like to be able to use this as a portfolio project in the future, so I plan to do everything at the highest level and add in all features possible.
